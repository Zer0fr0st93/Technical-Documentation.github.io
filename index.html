    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
    </p>
    <h2>So what is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
    </p>
    <pre>My cat is very grumpy</pre>
    <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>&ltp>My cat is very grumpy&lt/p></code>
    </pre>
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Elements">
    <header>Elements</header>
    <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
    <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9347/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="paragraph element"/>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins, or starts to take effect — in this case where the start of the paragraph
        is.</li>
      <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph is. Failing to include a closing
        tag is one of the common beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
      <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</li>
      <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, plus the closing tag, plus the content, equals the element.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Images">
    <header>Images</header>
    <p>Let's turn our attention to the image element again:</p>
    <pre>
    <code>&ltimg src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt</code>
    </pre>
    <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Marking_up_text">
    <header>Marking up text</header>
    <p>This section will cover some of the basic HTML elements you'll use for marking up text.</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings —or subheadings— of your content. In the same way that a book has a main title, chapter titles and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains six heading
      levels, &lth1>–&lth6> although you'll commonly only use 3–4 at most:
        <pre><code>
          <h1>My main title</h1>
          <h2>My top level heading</h2>
          <h3>My subheading</h3>
          <h4>My sub-subheading</h4>          
        </code></pre>  
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Links">
    <header>Links</header>
    <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the Web A WEB. To add a link, we need to use a simple element — &lta&gt — the a being short for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
      <li>Wrap the text in an &lta&gt element, like so:
        <pre><code>&lta>Mozilla Manifesto&lt/a></code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>Give the &lta> element an href attribute, like so:
        <pre><code>&lta href="">Mozilla Manifesto&lt/a></code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to:
        <pre><code>&lta href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto&lt/a></code></pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.</p>
